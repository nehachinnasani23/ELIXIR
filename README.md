HTML/CSS:


The HTML/CSS code defines the structure and styling of the web page. It includes a simple heading and paragraph, and a div element with an id of "output" which will be used to display the results of the user input. The CSS styles can be added inside the style tags.

JavaScript:


The JavaScript code defines a function called sendRequest() which sends a request to the Elixir backend when the user clicks a button. The function retrieves the input value entered by the user, creates an XMLHttpRequest object, sets the request headers and method, and defines a callback function to handle the response. The payload is then converted to a JSON string and sent to the server. When the response is received, the function parses the JSON response and displays the result in the div element with an id of "output".

Elixir:


The Elixir code defines a router module which listens for requests on the "/process" endpoint. When a POST request is received, it retrieves the input value from the request payload and processes it. In this example, the input is simply concatenated with a string to create a result. The result is then returned as a JSON response.



Finally, the MyApp.Application module starts the Phoenix endpoint, which runs the router module and listens for incoming requests.

Overall, this code creates a simple web application that allows the user to enter some text and sends it to the backend for processing. The backend simply concatenates the input with a string and returns the result, which is then displayed on the web page.
