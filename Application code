First, you need to create a new Elixir project using the Mix build tool. Open your terminal and type the following command:

javascript
Copy code
mix new my_dashboard
This will create a new Elixir project named "my_dashboard" with the default project structure.

Next, you can add the necessary dependencies to your project by updating the mix.exs file. For example, you may want to use the Phoenix framework to build your dashboard. In that case, you can add the following dependencies:

elixir
Copy code
defp deps do
  [
    {:phoenix, "~> 1.5.7"},
    {:phoenix_html, "~> 2.14"},
    {:phoenix_live_view, "~> 0.16.2"},
    {:phoenix_ecto, "~> 4.1.0"},
    {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.5.1"},
    {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end

After adding the dependencies, you can install them by running the following command in the terminal:

csharp
Copy code
mix deps.get
Next, you can generate a new Phoenix controller to handle your dashboard requests by running the following command:

Copy code
mix phx.gen.html Dashboard Dashboard dashboards
This will create a new controller named DashboardController with a corresponding Elixir module and views to handle requests for your dashboard. The command will also generate the necessary routes in the router.ex file.

In the DashboardController, you can define the actions and views to handle the different requests for your dashboard. For example, you can define an index action to handle the main dashboard page:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule MyDashboardWeb.DashboardController do
  use MyDashboardWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "index.html"
  end
end
You can then create a corresponding index.html.eex view in the lib/my_dashboard_web/templates/dashboard/ directory to display the content of your dashboard.
